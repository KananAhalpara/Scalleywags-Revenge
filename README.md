ASSIGNMENT : AS FOLLOWS :

Goal : Re-create the New Photoshop Mock-up as closely as possible! Create the entire HTML/CSS one-page site using only the PSD for reference.

Guidelines
All visual assets and measurements can be found in the Photoshop Mock-up
All font sizes, line heights, margins and padding are accounted for (Use Character & Paragraph windows)
All colours are also given to you (use the Eyedropper Tool to isolate pixels)
Only has to look good in Chrome or Safari (don’t worry about cross-browser perfection)
Do not worry about being pixel-accurate. You can match the PSD perfectly, but it would take a lot of fine-tuning (and possibly hair-pulling) for that 100% accuracy. Match the “intent” as closely as possible.
The final product does not have to be responsive.
Creating the Images
You may need to use the Save-for-Web tool and the Slice Tool (C-key, with Crop Tool) 
Hint: You can do this assignment with as little as five (5) images and modern CSS
Building the Layout
Use a .wrapper to contain all elements and set a width for the entire contents
Use proper semantic structure: <header> <section> <footer> etc etc....
Don’t forget to add the CSS for Meyer Reset and Perishable Press’ “New” Clearfix (you may need it)
The Navigation
Use modern <ul> <li> <a> navigation. The Mock-up shows the, “Active” page, a  Link/Visited and Hover states.
You can build the menu without any images using modern CSS code (remember your training)

Draft version due at end of class Today.
Final version due by 11:59pm (right before midnight) on Thursday, December 21.
Sorry, no late submissions accepted!

Submitting
Hand In: Complete “home” Folder: HTML, CSS, Images

Put it all in a directory named “Lastname-Firstname-Assignment-7” (eg. “Kingsbury-Rob-Assignment-7”) including all html, css and images, properly placed in subfolders. Links should be coded as <a> tags, but do not have to work - use a hash tag in the href, eg. <a href="#">...</a>

Be sure to include your Original Content NoticePreview the document and/or your ReferencesPreview the document in the zip file.

Marks:

/ 2 points for completion and accuracy (compared to original Photoshop file) IN CLASS
